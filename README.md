## A fully functional project written in Node.js showing how to create a REST API

This is a simple Create/Post application where every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Create a custom web server with Node.JS using HTTPRouter
* Create a Mongoose DataBase which saves the data in cloud 
* Create a Cloudinary 
* Create a front end with React 
* Create a Tailwind UI
# [Live Demo]

## Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Tailwind] - an open source CSS framework
- [OpenAi] - Artificial intelligence Bot
- [Cloudinary] - Cloudinary is a software solution based on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- [Vite] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
- [Mongoose] - Cloud Database
## BackEnd Installation
